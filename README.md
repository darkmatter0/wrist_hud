# Description

How bad ass would it be to have a wrist band that has a summary of your current attacks. In addition, it has buttons that allow you to change modes and quickly start new attacks. The wrist band uses a teensy, the TFT display, WiFi, a LiPo battery and a USB charge controller.

* The teensy uses SPI to talk to the display.

* The teensy talks to the Xbee or WiFi over serial
